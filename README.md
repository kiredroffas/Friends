Designed a web page-based application Friends to maintain contact information with friends. Implemented through Meteor (JavaScript,HTML,CSS) 
frameworks, the webpage provided the following functionalities: 

A login page where user is promted to login, information will not show unless user is logged in.
After login the main page allows for the user to add a new contact, or edit an existing contact. Each will redirect the user to a add
contact/edit contact page, where the only difference are the text fields and the submit button.
User can logout and their stored information will be saved.

Application based off of the CS320A7 template.

If meteor not installed: cd app -> meteor npm install
To run in IntelliJ IDEA: cd app -> meteor npm run start -> open localhost link
To reset the Mongo database: cd app -> meteor reset
